# 3. Accessibility

Web pages and applications should be accessible to all users, including those with visual, motor, hearing, and cognitive impairments. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, you'll be asked to show you can integrate accessibility best practices into your web pages and applications by:

- Using a logical tab order for tabbed navigation
- Using skip navigation links to bypass navbars and asides
- Avoiding hidden content on the page that impedes tab navigation
- Using heading tags that provide a logical page structure
- Using text alternatives to visual content, such as `alt`, `<label>`, `aria-label`, and `aria-labelledby`
- Applying color contrast to all elements and following accessibility best practices
- Sending timely alerts for urgent messages using `aria-live`
- Using semantic markup to keep content and presentation separate when appropriate
