# 1. Basic website layout and styling

Users expect responsive and visually engaging websites regardless of the device. A web application's layout and styling must respond to the current display, while continuing to provide intuitive functionality. You'll be asked to show you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a web application’s responsive layout and style that includes:

- DOM elements that are accessed and manipulated using only JavaScript without the overhead of libraries or frameworks (such as jQuery)
- Appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags
- A responsive grid-based layout using CSS
- Media queries that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes
- Multimedia tags to display video or play audio
- Responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device
- Touch and mouse events that contain large hit targets on the front end and work regardless of platform
