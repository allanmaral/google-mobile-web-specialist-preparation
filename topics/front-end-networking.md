# 2. Front-end networking

Because user engagement depends on reliable and effective network requests, you'll be asked to show you can use JavaScript to set up reliable front end networking protocols by:

- Requesting data using `fetch()`
- Checking response status, then parsing the data into usable format
- Rendering response data to a page
- Configuring `POST` requests to a database with `method` and `body` parameters
- Using correctly configured cross-origin resource sharing protocol (CORS) `fetch` requests, depending on the server’s response headers
- Handling `fetch()` request errors with promise chaining
- Diagnosing network issues using debugging and development tools
